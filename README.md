# Google-Data-Analytics-Project

This is a project of Google Data Analytics course on the Coursera. This final project will demonstrate the skills that I approach through the online course. This case study will demonstrate a real-world task of a data analyst.

# The scenario

In this case study, I am a data analyst at a company called working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations. 
# Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the differences between annual and casual riders in the Chicago city. The insights gained from this analysis will back up the idea that the maximizing the number of annual members will bring the benefits to the company. Moreover, this case study will also analyze the behaviors and pattern of customers. The result from this analysis will provide some ideas for the marketing strategy. 

# Characters and teams

•	Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
•	8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
•	Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
•	Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.
•	Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

# Data 

The data was collected based on the provided link https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. The closest 12 months data was selected for the analytic. There are totally 5,755,694 data points in this dataset. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.

  
# Tools: MySQL and Power BI

In this case study, the data will be loaded into MySQL local sever. Many basic analysis and cleaning data were done through SQL. The cleaning, data modeling, and visualization steps were done through the business intelligence tool called Power BI. 

# Result:

•	The member riders accounted for higher volume compared to the casual riders. This is kind of obvious because they are the ones who has the higher needs for using the service.
•	The customers had the trend of using service more in the weekend with a longer ride, especially in the Saturday. The casual riders are likely to use the service more in the weekend in which they had the high volume compared to member riders. In addition, the member riders had a longer riding time compared to casual riders. This shows that the casual rides likely use the services when they have the free time which is weekend in this case.
•	The peak time for cycling in the Chicago city is the summer and fall. Specifically, June and July seem to be the busiest time for the casual riders where there is not much difference in the number of casual riders and member riders. This can be explained that summer and fall are the best time for cycling, in which the weather is better than the winter and Spring.
•	In 3 types of bikes, electric bike is likely to be the most favorite. However, classic bike is mostly use from May to July. This is in the same period in which casual riders had the higher volume. This is because of the casual riders commonly use the shared bike that the station.
•	There is not much difference in the riding time choosing by casual and member riders. 5:00 PM is likely to be the time which has the most volume of cycling, followed by 8:00 AM. They are the time which is commonly use because customers are likely cycling for exercise before and after work.
•	In contrast with the number of rides by customers, docked bike had much higher in the length of ride.
•	The busiest stations are likely to be located along the coastline of the city which top 3 were Streeter Dr & Grand ave, DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe Street, and DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Blvd. They are also the most like used by the casual riders while member riders using other station. The coastline is the position where the tourist attractions located and has the best view for cycling. 

# Recommendation for further analysis:

•	This analysis can be extended by collecting more information about the customer such as age, sex, salary range, or address. These factors can help draw a more details picture about the customer behavior. 
•	Moreover, with more data points about the customers, the machine learning model can be applied to identify the factors that affect to the decision of using service of customers.
